The branch master is the main one, which make https://github.com/freenowtech/spring-multirabbit lib works on SpringBoot 3.2.x
There was a huge change in Spring-AMQP since Spring Boot 3.1.x, so the Spring MultiRabbit was not working anymore. Until now :)


The major change is in in CustomMultiRabbitAutoConfiguration and RabbitMQConnector.

Please help yourself.
